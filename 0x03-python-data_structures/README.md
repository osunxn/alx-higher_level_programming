# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description

The 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum, focusing on the study of Python data structures, particularly lists and tuples. The project covers various concepts and methods related to lists and tuples, as well as fundamental knowledge about sequences, list comprehensions, and more.

## Environment

* Language: Python
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Style: PEP 8

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, students are expected to be able to explain the following topics without the aid of external resources:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* Lists and their usage
* Differences and similarities between strings and lists
* Common list methods and their usage
* Implementation of lists as stacks and queues
* Understanding list comprehensions
* Tuples and their usage
* Differentiating use cases for tuples and lists
* Understanding sequences, tuple packing, and sequence unpacking
* Implementing the 'del' statement

## Resources

Read or watch:

* [3.1.3. Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
* [Data structures (until 5.3. Tuples and Sequences included)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
* [Learn to Program 6: Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohCDWZgNIU0)

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

* All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Code must follow PEP 8 style
* All files must be executable
* The length of the files will be tested using `wc`

### C

* All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All files end with a new line
* Code must follow the Betty style
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file called `lists.h`
* All header files should be include guarded

## Tasks

Each task has a corresponding script file in the `0x03-python-data_structures` directory. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

0. Print a list of integers
1. Secure access to an element in a list
2. Replace element
3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
4. Replace in a copy
5. Remove specific characters from a string
6. Print a matrix of integers
7. Add tuples
8. Return length and first character of a string
9. Find the maximum integer in a list
10. Find all multiples of 2 in a list
11. Delete at a specific position in a list
12. Switch values of a and b
13. Check if a singly linked list is a palindrome

### Advanced Tasks

14. Understand Python lists (CPython #0)
